Install the required packages as follows:\n\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n**WARNING\u203c\ufe0f** If you are NOT working in a Linux environment, you may have some issues with the packages **jax** and **jaxlib**, which are dependencies for the package **fuzzy-c-means**. The easiest workaround this issue is to uninstall these three packages, and make a clean install of fuzzy-c-means for your operative system as described in [the documentation of fuzzy-c-means](https://pypi.org/project/fuzzy-c-means/). After this, you everything should run smoothly.\n\nAs you can see in the figure above, GEnI comprises two main stages: embedding and prediction generation, and prediction explaination. While the second stage is performed intrinsically by GEnI, the first stage is external and is fully supported by PyKeen. \n",
