Make sure that you have [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) installed in order to download Node\n\n  **The most important part of this installation is making sure that you are running some version of 10**\n\n2. Check if you have Node installed already by using the command :\n```\nnode --version\n```\n\nIf that produces an error then you can simply download version 10 with the following command:\n```\nbrew install node@10\n```\n\nIf it\u2019s a version other than 10, you will need to downgrade/upgrade to version 10 - or Gatsby will not be able to start a development server or build a page.\n\nTo change to version 10, follow the following commands:\n```\nbrew search node\n```\nThis will give you an output similar to this:\n\n~~~out\n==> Formulae\nlibbitcoin-node   node-build     node@12       nodeenv\nllnode       node-sass      node_exporter    nodenv\nnode \u2713       node@10       nodebrew\n~~~\n\nNext, you will want to install version 10 with the command:\n\n~~~bash\nbrew install node@10\n~~~\n\nif the checkmark is currently on node we then unlink node from its current version first using:\n```\nbrew unlink node\n```\n\nThen, link version 10 that was just installed:\n```\nbrew link node@10\n```\n\nYou may also be prompted to specify that you need to have node@10 first in your PATH so you should run the command below before attempting force linking node@10 (the command above) again:\n\n```\necho 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/node@10/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n\nSometimes, linking to node@10 will need to be forced and thus will require:\n```\nbrew link --force --overwrite node@10\n```\n\nNext check again what version you are running to confirm that it is a version of 10. there is a possibility that an error will be produced so you can either permanently set your\n\n```\nnode --version\n```\n\nthis should output the following:\n\n~~~out\nv10.24.1\n~~~\n\nNow that we have this done, Gatsby\u2019s installation and building process should be much easier.\n\nInstall Gatsby\n\nThis should a single command to complete this and will install Gatsby globally on your computer.\n~~~\nnpm install -g gatsby-cli\n~~~\n\n**Warning:** Do not update your dependencies here.\n\n3. Fork the repository. Then clone it locally.\n\n4. On your terminal, locate yourself to the root of the repo.\n\n5. In order to run on local server, we must install all relevant dependencies by running the following:\n```\nnpm install\n```\n**Warning:** You will be prompted to run \"npm audit fix\" to fix them.\nI do not recommend doing this as it may burn your site down.\n\n\nDuring the build, you might see several ESLint errors. We are trying to fix them.\nHowever, the output below will still build your course:\n\n~~~out\nfound 572 vulnerabilities (4 low, 4 moderate, 564 high)\n~~~\n\n6. Finally, to build the site on your local:\n\n```\nnpm run dev  \n```\n\nDelivering this as an output (copy and paste this address into any browser) :\n\n~~~out\nYou can now view ec_workshops_py in the browser.\n\n  http://localhost:8000/\n~~~\n\nQuick link: http://localhost:8000/\n\nThis should be the beginning of a functioning starter-course!\n\nNow that you have a website that is deploying on your local server, we can now begin the steps to customize it to your own taste.\n",

Make sure that you have [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) installed in order to download Node\n\n  **The most important part of this installation is making sure that you are running some version of 10**\n\n2. Check if you have Node installed already by using the command :\n```\nnode --version\n```\n\nIf that produces an error then you can simply download version 10 with the following command:\n```\nbrew install node@10\n```\n\nIf it\u2019s a version other than 10, you will need to downgrade/upgrade to version 10 - or Gatsby will not be able to start a development server or build a page.\n\nTo change to version 10, follow the following commands:\n```\nbrew search node\n```\nThis will give you an output similar to this:\n\n~~~out\n==> Formulae\nlibbitcoin-node   node-build     node@12       nodeenv\nllnode       node-sass      node_exporter    nodenv\nnode \u2713       node@10       nodebrew\n~~~\n\nNext, you will want to install version 10 with the command:\n\n~~~bash\nbrew install node@10\n~~~\n\nif the checkmark is currently on node we then unlink node from its current version first using:\n```\nbrew unlink node\n```\n\nThen, link version 10 that was just installed:\n```\nbrew link node@10\n```\n\nYou may also be prompted to specify that you need to have node@10 first in your PATH so you should run the command below before attempting force linking node@10 (the command above) again:\n\n```\necho 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/node@10/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n\nSometimes, linking to node@10 will need to be forced and thus will require:\n```\nbrew link --force --overwrite node@10\n```\n\nNext check again what version you are running to confirm that it is a version of 10. there is a possibility that an error will be produced so you can either permanently set your\n\n```\nnode --version\n```\n\nthis should output the following:\n\n~~~out\nv10.24.1\n~~~\n\nNow that we have this done, Gatsby\u2019s installation and building process should be much easier.\n\nInstall Gatsby\n\nThis should a single command to complete this and will install Gatsby globally on your computer.\n~~~\nnpm install -g gatsby-cli\n~~~\n\n**Warning:** Do not update your dependencies here.\n\n3. Fork the repository. Then clone it locally.\n\n4. On your terminal, locate yourself to the root of the repo.\n\n5.
