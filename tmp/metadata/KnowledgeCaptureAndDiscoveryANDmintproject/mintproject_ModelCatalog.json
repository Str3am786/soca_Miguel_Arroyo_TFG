The repository is organized as follows (see respective readme files in subfolders to know more about each of their contents):\n * AutomaticLayoutDetection: Script that given a layout file extracted automatically from a dataset, it transforms it into the DataCubes representation from W3C. \n * CSVToRDF: Scripts to transform all model contents in /Data to RDF.\n * Data: All CSV files containing information of the models, their metadata and variables. The data is organized so the columns represent properties and data properties of the ontology, while the rows are instances described and linked in the models (e.g., input types, variables, etc.)\n * ExportCatalog: Scripts to extract the contents of the model catalogs as a series of CSVs.\n * GSNVariableImport: Scripts that query the current contents of the model catalog to extract GSNs (now SVOs) and bring the appropriate context into the model catalog. Additional links to Wikidata are created in the process. \n * OtherTransformations: Legacy scripts to organize information about units.\n * UnitToRDF: Scripts designed to align unit labels provided by modelers (e.g., \"m/day\") to a semantic representation. \n \n",
