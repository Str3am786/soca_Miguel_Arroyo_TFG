            "excerpt": "NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a file format for storing multidimensional scientific data (`variables`) such as pressure, surface temperature, soil moisture content and wind speed. It has been adopted as a standard way to represent scientific data as it facilitates data access. Its main advantages are<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>:\n  - self-describing: it includes information about the data it continas so that no external tables are needed to interpret it\n  - machine-independent: portable  across different platforms, eg. MacOS, Windows, Linux\n  - scalable: a small subset of a large netCDF file can be accessed efficinetly without reading the entire file \n  \n\nWe would like to start a discussion on the common convention for structured gridded data for MINT by proposing the following specifications.  We have consulted the Unidata group's [recommendation](#) on the netCDF attributions for data discovery as well as the [CF Conventions](http://cfconventions.org/), the [Attirubte Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD)](https://is.gd/IKZ3CQ), and the Open Geospatial Convention [document](https://tinyurl.com/yyoz4bxb). \n\nThe purpose of this specification is to establish a unified NetCDF format within MINT (and in the near future, among World Moderlers) for an efficient data exchange and knowledge discovery. In addition, we have created an interactive tool for explororing datasets conforming to this specification (See Figure 1 for a quick demo).  We welcome your comments, questions, and any suggestions you might have. Please submit your comments [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eT_Z51R4VwVen-qx7XGtNjoHuc2sMlYmmxbi5acumx0/edit?usp=sharing). \n\n",
