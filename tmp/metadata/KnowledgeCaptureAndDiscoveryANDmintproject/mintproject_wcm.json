            "excerpt": "Once wcm is installed, configure your credentials to use a wings server\n\n```bash\nC:\\Users\\Admin>wcm configure\nWINGS Server URL: \nWINGS Export URL: http://localhost:8080\nWINGS User: myUsername\nWINGS Password:\nWINGS Domain: wings-domain\nSuccess \n\n```\n\nNow you can begin using wcm. First list the components on the wings instance you specified on the credentials\n\n```bash\nC:\\Users\\Admin>wcm list\n[Economic]\n  \u2514\u2500\u2510\n    \u251c\u2500 economic-v6\n    \u251c\u2500 economictest-v5\n    \u251c\u2500 economicnodata-v6\n    \u251c\u2500 economic-different-data-v6\n    \u2514\u2500 economicwcmtest \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n[Hydrological]\n   \u2514\u2500\u2510                                                                                                                   \n     \u251c\u2500 HAND-1\n     \u251c\u2500 hand_final-v1\n     \u251c\u2500 hand-v1\n     \u2514\u2500 handnodata-v1.0.1 \n\nDone\n```\n\nNext, you can download one of these components. Let's choose economic-v6. First you need to navigate into the directory you want to download the component to. Alternatively you could also use the -f <filepath> argument to specify a filepath for the component to be downloaded to\n\n```bash\nC:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\down>ls\n\nC:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\down>wcm download economic-v5\n2019-08-13 14:52:02,082 root         INFO     Downloading component\n2019-08-13 14:52:02,226 root         INFO     Generated YAML \n2019-08-13 14:52:02,256 root         INFO     Download complete\nDownload complete  \n\nC:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\down>ls\neconomic-v6       \n```\n\nWhen you download a component it comes in three parts. The wings-component.yaml file which stores the components data. The src folder which stores the sorce code. And the data folder, which at the moment is just a placeholder\n\nAfter downloading the economic-v5 component, you may edit some of the source code. To upload a new version (6.1 in the example), use the publish command\n\n```bash\nC:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\down>ls\neconomic-v6.1\n\nC:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\down>wcm publish economic-v6.1\n2019-08-13 15:04:08,540 root         INFO     Publishing component\nSuccess                                                                                                                 \n\n```\n\nNow lets check the list command to make sure it was published\n\n```bash\nC:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\down>wcm list\n[Economic]\n  \u2514\u2500\u2510\n    \u251c\u2500 economic-v6\n    \u251c\u2500 economictest-v5\n    \u251c\u2500 economicnodata-v6\n    \u251c\u2500 economic-different-data-v6\n    \u251c\u2500 economicwcmtest\n    \u2514\u2500 economic-v6.1\n\n[Hydrological]\n  \u2514\u2500\u2510\n    \u251c\u2500 HAND-1\n    \u251c\u2500 hand_final-v1\n    \u251c\u2500 hand-v1\n    \u2514\u2500 handnodata-v1.0.1\n\nDone\n```\n\nAnd now the economic-v6.1 component has been uploaded to WINGS\n\n\n",
