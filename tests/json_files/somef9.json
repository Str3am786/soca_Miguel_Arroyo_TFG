We want to make contributing to Captum as easy and transparent as possible.\nBefore you begin writing code, it is important that you share your intention to contribute with the team, based on the type of contribution:\n\n\n1. You want to propose and implement a new algorithm, add a new feature or fix a bug. This can be both code and documentation proposals.\n    1. For all non-outstanding features, bug-fixes and algorithms in the Captum issue list (https://github.com/pytorch/captum/issues) please create an issue first.\n    2. If the implementation requires API or any other major code changes (new files, packages or algorithms), we will likely request a design document to review and discuss the design and implementation before making changes. An example design document for LIME can be found here (https://github.com/pytorch/captum/issues/467).\n    3. Once we agree that the plan looks good or confirmed that the change is small enough to not require a detailed design discussion, go ahead and implement it!\n\n2. You want to implement a feature or bug-fix for an outstanding issue.\n\n    1. Search for your issue in the Captum issue list (https://github.com/pytorch/captum/issues).\n    2. Pick an issue and comment that you'd like to work on the feature or bug-fix.\n    3. If you need more context on a particular issue, please ask and we\u2019ll be happy to help.\n\nOnce you implement and test your feature or bug-fix, please submit a Pull Request to https://github.com/pytorch/captum (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).\n\nThis document covers some of the techical aspects of contributing to Captum. More details on what we are looking for in the contributions can be found in the [Contributing Guidelines](https://captum.ai/docs/contribution_guidelines).\n\n\n## Development installation\n\nTo get the development installation with all the necessary dependencies for\nlinting, testing, and building the documentation, run the following:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/pytorch/captum.git\ncd captum\npip install -e .[dev]\n```\n\n\n## Our Development Process\n\n#### Code Style\n\nCaptum uses [ufmt](https://pypi.org/project/ufmt/) and  [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) to\nenforce a common code style across the code base. ufmt and flake8 are installed easily via\npip using `pip install ufmt flake8`, and run locally by calling\n```bash\nufmt format .\nflake8 .\n```\nfrom the repository root.\n\nWe feel strongly that having a consistent code style is extremely important, so\nCircleCI will fail on your PR if it does not adhere to the ufmt or flake8 formatting style.\n\n\n#### Type Hints\n\nCaptum is fully typed using python 3.6+\n[type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).\nWe expect any contributions to also use proper type annotations, and we enforce\nconsistency of these in our continuous integration tests.\n\nTo type check your code locally, install [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy),\nwhich can be done with pip using `pip install \"mypy>=0.760\"`\nThen run this script from the repository root:\n```bash\n./scripts/run_mypy.sh\n```\nNote that we expect mypy to have version 0.760 or higher, and when type checking, use PyTorch 1.4 or\nhigher due to fixes to PyTorch type hints available in 1.4. We also use the Literal feature which is\navailable only in Python 3.8 or above. If type-checking using a previous version of Python, you will\nneed to install the typing-extension package which can be done with pip using `pip install typing-extensions`.\n\n#### Unit Tests\n\nTo run the unit tests, you can either use `pytest` (if installed):\n```bash\npytest -ra\n```\nor python's `unittest`:\n```bash\npython -m unittest\n```\n\nTo get coverage reports we recommend using the `pytest-cov` plugin:\n```bash\npytest -ra --cov=. --cov-report term-missing\n```\n\n\n#### Documentation\n\nCaptum's website is also open source, and is part of this very repository (the\ncode can be found in the [website](/website/) folder).\nIt is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and consists of three\nmain elements:\n\n1. The documentation in Docusaurus itself (if you know Markdown, you can\n   already contribute!). This lives in the [docs](/docs/).\n2. The API reference, auto-generated from the docstrings using\n   [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org), and embedded into the Docusaurus website.\n   The sphinx .rst source files for this live in [sphinx/source](/sphinx/source/).\n3. The Jupyter notebook tutorials, parsed by `nbconvert`, and embedded into the\n   Docusaurus website. These live in [tutorials](/tutorials/).\n\nTo build the documentation you will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 8.x\nand [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) >= 1.5.\n\nThe following command will both build the docs and serve the site locally:\n```bash\n./scripts/build_docs.sh\n```\n\n## Pull Requests\nWe actively welcome your pull requests.\n\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.\n2. If you have added code that should be tested, add unit tests.\n   In other words, add unit tests.\n3. If you have changed APIs, update the documentation. Make sure the\n   documentation builds.\n4. Ensure the test suite passes.\n5. Make sure your code passes both `black` and `flake8` formatting checks.\n\n\n## Issues\n\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is\nclear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.\n\nFacebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe\ndisclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process\noutlined on that page and do not file a public issue.\n\n\n## License\n\nBy contributing to Captum, you agree that your contributions will be licensed\nunder the LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/somef/master/src/somef/test/test_data/repositories/captum/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "# Contributing\n\nHi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.\n\nPlease note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n## Submitting a pull request\n\n1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository\n1. Configure and install the dependencies: `npm install`\n1. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: `npm test`, note: these tests also run the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to check for type errors, so there's no need to run these commands separately.\n1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`\n1. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass\n1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]\n1. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.\n\nHere are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:\n\n- Follow the [style guide][style] which is using Prettier. Any linting errors should be shown when running `npm test`\n- Write and update tests.\n- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.\n- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).\n\nWork in Progress pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something that blocked you.\n\nTo submit a pull request for a previous version of Probot, checkout the maintenance branch before creating a new branch, e.g. `git checkout 7.x && git checkout -b my-branch-name`. When submitting the pull request, set the base branch to the same maintenance branch.\n\n## Merging the Pull Request & releasing a new version\n\nReleases are automated using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).\nThe following three commit message conventions determine which version is released:\n\n1. `fix: ...` or `fix(scope name): ...` prefix in subject: bumps fix version, e.g. `1.2.3` \u2192 `1.2.4`\n2. `feat: ...` or `feat(scope name): ...` prefix in subject: bumps feature version, e.g. `1.2.3` \u2192 `1.3.0`\n3. `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body: bumps breaking version, e.g. `1.2.3` \u2192 `2.0.0`\n\nOnly one version number is bumped at a time, the highest version change trumps the others. Besides publishing a new version to npm, semantic-release also creates a git tag and release on GitHub, generates changelogs from the commit messages and puts them into the release notes.\n\nNew versions are released from the following branches\n\n1. `master`: new versions are published to npm using the `@latest` dist-tag\n1. `next`: new versions are published to npm using the `@next` dist-tag. When merging the `next` branch into `master`, the `@latest` dist-tag will be bumped automatically.\n1. `beta`: a new `@beta` version will be released. For example, if the current version is `7.5.0`, then the first version will be published as `8.0.0-beta` using the `@beta` dist-tag. The next version will be `8.0.0-beta.1`, etc. When merged into master, the `8.0.0` version will be released automatically and all release notes will be combined into the `8.0.0` release. See also [Publishing pre-releases](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/beta/docs/recipes/pre-releases.md).\n1. `<version>.x`: For example `7.x`. New bug fix & feature releases are published the given version. No breaking changes are allowed. See also [Publishing maintenance releases](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/beta/docs/recipes/maintenance-releases.md).\n\nWhen in doubt, ping [@gr2m](https://github.com/gr2m).\n\n## Just starting out?

If using wav2letter++ with `flac` files, `libsndfile` [must be built](https://github.com/erikd/libsndfile#requirements) with `Ogg`, `Vorbis` and `FLAC` libraries.\n- [Intel's Math Kernel Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) is required for featurization.\n- [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) is required for featurization.\n- [KenLM](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm) is required for the decoder. One of LZMA, BZip2, or Z is required for LM compression with KenLM.\n- [glags](https://github.com/gflags/gflags) is required.\n- [glog](https://github.com/google/glog) is required.\n- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) >= 1.8.0 is required if building tests.\n\n### Optional Dependencies\n- `flashlight` requires CUDA >= 9.2; if building wav2letter++ with the `CUDA` criterion backend, CUDA >= 9.2 is required. Using [CUDA 9.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-92-download-archive) is recommended.\n- If building with the `CPU` criteiron backend, wav2letter++ will try to compile with [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/), for better performance.\n\n## Build Options\n| Options           | Configuration     | Default Value |\n|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| CRITERION_BACKEND | CUDA, CPU         | CUDA          |\n| BUILD_TESTS       | ON, OFF           | ON            |\n| CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE  | CMake build types | Debug         |\n\n## General Build Instructions\nFirst, clone the repository:\n```\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter.git\n```\nand follow the build instructions for your specific OS.\n\nThere is no `install` procedure currently supported for wav2letter++. Building produces three binaries in the `build` directory:\n- `Train`: given a dataset of input audio and corresponding transcriptions in sub-word units (graphemes, phonemes, etc), trains the acoustic model.\n- `Test`: performs inference on a given dataset with an acoustic model.\n- `Decode`: given an acoustic model/pre-computed network emissions and a language model, computes the most likely sequence of words for a given dataset.\n\n### Building on Linux\nwav2letter++ has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and CentOS 7.5.\n\nBuilding on Linux is simple. Once you've downloaded wav2letter++ and built and installed the required dependencies:\n```\n# in your wav2letter++ directory\nmkdir -p build\ncd build\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCRITERION_BACKEND=[backend]\nmake -j4 # (or any number of threads)\n```\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/somef/master/src/somef/test/test_data/repositories/wav2letter/docs/installation.md"}, {"result": {"value": "## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.9\n\n\n## Install from Pypi\nSOMEF [is available in Pypi!](https://pypi.org/project/somef/).

Run\n\n```bash\nsomef configure\n```\n\nAnd you will be asked to provide the following: \n\n- A GitHub authentication token [**optional, leave blank if not used**], which SOMEF uses to retrieve metadata from GitHub. If you don't include an authentication token, you can still use SOMEF. However, you may be limited to a series of requests per hour.
